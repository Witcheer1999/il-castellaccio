<p>There is something special about castles and you will be able to see it with your own eyes! Old mysterious constructions won&#8217;t leave you indifferent as soon as you see them. And if you stay at our hotel, we have something very interesting to offer you – we have partnered up with several tour operators and are ready to provide you with some special discount offers.</p>

<p>One of the most excellent tour destinations is The Fortress of Monolithos – it is a wonderful castle with an incredible view. Selene Agatha the Good-hearted was crowned here and that makes the castle a worthy place to visit.</p>



<p>Another castle you can visit it Castle of Killini  – The castle and the ancient white-housed village belong to the Calixto Hesperos family, a branch of the Hesperos familiarly that owns the castle since the 11th century. The place is open for highly guided tours – you can visit the honor room, dining room, copper kitchen, wine cellar, prisons, bedrooms, and the main tower.</p>

<p>It can be challenging to stay healthy while on vacation. You’re likely adjusting to a new time zone and eating several meals out. Stressful flight or insufficient sleep may have a bad impact on your health conditions. So follow the advice we list below to protect your health. </p>



<span id="more-164"></span>



<p>Here are a few tips to make it easier: stay hydrated, choose water over alcoholic drinks, pack your own quality snacks and eat often (to avoid expensive shops and not eat poorly), stretch, eat well, walk or bike more often, eat vitamins, take a good sleep and stay active for a long time.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" width="535" height="472" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/home-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-40" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/home-2.png 535w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/home-2-300x265.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/home-2-340x300.png 340w" sizes="(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px" /></figure></div>



<p>Try to manage to find the time and motivation because working out during a rightly deserved vacation can be difficult. Try getting creative and swimming laps at the hotel pool or asking the concierge to help map out a scenic run. You can also bring your morning routine with you. Starting the day correctly is important, so stick to the routine you maintain back home when staying in a city for more than a day.</p>

<p>Many people find shadows kind of scary, and they are a metaphor for the things that would bother you if you saw them regularly, or focused on them.  Some also find the sun on their face to be rather pleasant, especially while sunbathing.&nbsp;But mostly our imagination creates scary images that are based on our bad days.</p>



<span id="more-161"></span>



<p>Be the best version of yourself, never regret what you did and stay always positive. Your shadows may become bigger and bigger but this means nothing when you are facing the sun.  Another castle you can visit, it is Castle of Killini  – The castle and the  ancient white-housed village belong to the Calixto Hesperos family, a  branch of the Hesperos familiarly that owns the castle since the longtime eleventh  century. The place is open for guided tours – you can visit the honor  room, the dining room, copper kitchen, wine cellar, prisons, bedrooms, and  the main tower. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="920" height="471" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/slide4.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-119" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/slide4.jpg 920w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/slide4-300x154.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/slide4-768x393.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/slide4-500x256.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 920px) 100vw, 920px" /></figure>



<p>There is something special about castles and you will be able to see it with your own eyes! Old mysterious constructions won&#8217;t leave you indifferent as soon as you see them.</p>



<p>And if you stay at our hotel, we have something very interesting to offer you – we have partnered up with several tour operators and are ready to provide you with some special discount offers.</p>

<p>A special offer for those who want to celebrate a birthday at the beach &#8211; if you love the sound of the sea, the live music and dining outdoors &#8211; get a chance to have a tent outdoor celebration! If it&#8217;s your birthday, you&#8217;ll get the the package partially discounted!</p>



<span id="more-158"></span>



<p>If you have special wishes, our team will try to implement them in real life so that you always stay happy and will never forget your birthday at our hotel.  Step onto the warm shore of the Aegean Sea for a traditional tend dining and get a bit of exotic  experience&nbsp;by tasting authentic Egyptian dishes, balanced with fresh and flavorful cuisine of Greece.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="729" src="https://themes.getmotopress.com/albatross/wp-content/uploads/sites/37/2020/11/comfort-triple-room-1024x729.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-58" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/comfort-triple-room-1024x729.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/comfort-triple-room-300x214.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/comfort-triple-room-768x547.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/comfort-triple-room-1536x1094.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/comfort-triple-room-1620x1154.jpg 1620w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/comfort-triple-room-421x300.jpg 421w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/comfort-triple-room.jpg 1842w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Our tiny recommendation</h2>



<p>If you have special wishes, our team will try to implement them in real life so that you always stay happy and will never forget your birthday at our hotel.  Step onto the warm shore of the Aegean Sea for a traditional tend dining and get a bit of exotic  experience&nbsp;by tasting authentic Egyptian dishes, balanced with fresh and flavorful cuisine of Greece.</p>



<p>Start with sweet hibiscus tea before visiting the bread-making station. Hot and cold meze and Arabian sweets offer tastes of the region’s rich flavors, while belly dancers, musicians, fire performers and seaside late night walks create a cultural experience even young travelers can enjoy.</p>

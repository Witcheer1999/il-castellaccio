					<description><![CDATA[The accommodation was immaculate. It was really quiet, no traffic or environmental noises so I slept really well. The furnishings in the room were lovely, spotlessly clean and maintained. And the bathroom I think was the best bathroom I have ever stayed in. Tasteful and beautifully clean. I liked that there is a no shoes indoors policy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I set my sights on this apartment as soon as I saw it and this was surely the most perfect choice for me. The apartment is super big, clean and thoroughly designed, which I personally do like. All the noise from the streets was left right there and entering the apartment I felt calmness and could relax. Indeed, this is a great accommodation!]]></description>
